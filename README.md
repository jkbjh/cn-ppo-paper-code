# Code for Paper: "Colored Noise in PPO: Improved Exploration and Performance Through Correlated Action Sampling"

This repository contains the code to use temporally correlated colored
noise in PPO and to reproduce the experiments in our paper [Colored
Noise in PPO: Improved Exploration and Performance Through Correlated
Action Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11091) (accepted at
AAAI-24).

This paper extends the use of temporally correlated colored noise from
our previous work on colored off-policy reinforcement learning "Pink
Noise is All you Need" to **on-policy reinforcement learning**.

For more information, on colored noise and especially pink noise in
**off-policy RL** see [Pink Noise is All You
Need](https://github.com/martius-lab/pink-noise-rl)
